Revision history for Text-Ngram

0.08  Fri Oct 28 16:40:00 2005
	- fixed a bug (thanks to Greg) that had apparently been
	  lurking around since the beginning of times (bug would only
	  expose itself whenever the lowercase flag not set, which wouldn't
	  happen often, as it probably isn't common to search for case-sensitive
	  ngrams); digging deeper to understand the bug, by the way,
	  has unleashed a hell of confusion given that the documentation has a
	  couple of minor bugs that can become a major PITA in certain
	  situations... the module is safe to use if you don't want to
	  do major hacks with uppercased ngrams, but another version will
	  probably be available soon (for certain values of soon)
	- added tests for behavior with lowercase flag not set

	- fixed a bug introduced in 0.06, thanks to Marcus (always remember to

        - added more tests
        - added configuration, allowing parameter "punctuation", "spaces",
          "lowercase" and "flankbreaks"; the default configuration is backwards
          compatible

          to an empty hash
